## What is this?
Welcome to the JEEC Development Team Challenge! The objective of this challenge is to complete a basic web application that we provide in this repository.
The application consists of two separate pages: one displaying the list of speakers @ JEEC|20 and another one displaying the information of one specific speaker.

We provide the designs that display how the final application must look like in the end. You can check it in the **mockup.pdf** file, or in **mockup.xd** in case you feel comfortable using the software **Adobe XD**, which is free and can be downloaded in the following link: https://www.adobe.com/pt/products/xd.html.

The necessary static files (images, etc..) are located in the /webapp/static directory.

## Instruction to deploy the webapp
1. Fork this repository
2. Install dependencies inside the /webapp directory with:
    - `npm install`
3. Deploy the Vue.js application with:
    - `npm run dev`

### Requirements
* Basics of Vue.js framework:
    - Declarative Rendering
    - Conditionals and Loops
    - Components
    - List Rendering
* HTML
* Basic CSS concepts like:
    - flexbox
    - mobile responsive design

### Tips
* Declarative rendering is a PLUS! Without using it the code gets really messy, because all the text is hard coded in the HTML!
* Use media queries!
* Flexbox's will make your life way easier..
