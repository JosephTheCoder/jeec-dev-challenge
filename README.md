## What is this?
Welcome to the JEEC Development Team Challenge! The objective of this challenge is to complete a basic web application that we provide in this repository.
The application consists of two separate pages: **one displaying the list of speakers @ JEEC|20** and **another one displaying the information of one specific speaker.**

We provide the designs displaying how the final application must look like in the end, which are located in the file **mockup.xd**. This file can be opened using the software **Adobe XD**, which is free and can be downloaded in the following link: https://www.adobe.com/pt/products/xd.html.

## Instruction to deploy the webapp
1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies inside the /webapp directory with:
    - `npm install`
3. Deploy the Vue.JS application with:
    - `npm run dev`

### Requirements
* Basics of Vue.JS framework:
    - Declarative Rendering
    - Conditionals and Loops
    - Components
    - List Rendering
* HTML
* Basic CSS concepts like:
    - flexbox
    - mobile responsive design

### Tips
Declarative rendering is a PLUS! Without using this the code tends to get really messy, because all of the text is hard-coded in the HTML!
Use media queries!
